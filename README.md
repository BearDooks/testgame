# Remote Island Survival v0.2-alpha

## Planned update
This update aims to begin the automation part of the game. I will be looking into the systems that are currently in place as well as adding new ones. There is a possibility that some of the systems will need to be removed in order to get things working correctly. The stamina system is being investigated for it's worth, and how it will continue to play a role when the system moves to full automation. 

I will also be looking into consolidating some of the code to make it smaller and more managable in terms of reusing elements or functions.

## Can you survive on the island??

You wake on what appears to be an remote island in the middle of no where. You can't remember how you go there, or where you came from. Can you survive in this new world?

This is a game where you make decisions for the player on the island of what to do and what to make. Each choice can have a direct impact on your island life.
